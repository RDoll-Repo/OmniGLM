# Omni-GLM API
README contents TBD

Documentation is pending workflow changes. For example, as this is a multi-module project, I wonder if the onus of maintaining the roadmap should really be on the API when perhaps an external repository would be more appropriate. TODO: Remove this note once documentation workflow is decided on.

## Documentation
- [API Spec](APISpec.md)
- [Schema](CurrentSchema.png)
